In this file, we will attempt to figure out which encryption method is used.

In the actual SS application, the content is decrypted once the application is running, and rendering on the phone/tablet screen.
This likely means that the program has to have the decryption key on disk, and is also available even if the device is offline (i.e. no Internet connection).

In Line 4, I meant to say that the decryption key is loaded from storage into memory, and readily decrypts the relevant *.json files when the user makes a call to that file e.g. user buys a bundle for 20 keys, and the wallet.json is update to reduce the keys value by 20. When the app is closed, the jsons seem to be encrypted again.

It is imperative that the decryption is identified and can be reliably proven to decrypt the relevant jsons.
